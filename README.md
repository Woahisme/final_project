Threat Siphon - Final Project, Fall '21

To run:

0 - install dependencies from package.json
1 - start up index.js
2 - navigate to local host in browser
3 - input name and email
4 - copy over name to properly run fbscraper.py - flask to be implemented to bridge python/javascript gap
5 - Uncomment to pass through appropriate variables. Note that for Shodan, there will likely be no results
6 - I ran Shodan_v01.html on its own light server for the purposes of the demo; still working through properly commmunication and parameter sharing via super agent 
7 - breachaccounts.json and fb_info.json are currently being used as work arounds to pull from. They are blank/scrubbed for privacy purposes
8 - fb cookies are required to use the API, I've scrubbed that as well.

Next steps:
- Additional parameter sharing; issue with files recognizing my directories
- Proper templating for the user interface
